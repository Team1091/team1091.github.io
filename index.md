FRC Team 1091 Oriole Assault is composed of high school students with a goal of creating a robot in 6 weeks.  During
those weeks the students have an opportunity to learn and hone skills including CAD, machining, programming, electronics,
and teamwork.

We are a family first and foremost, not related by blood, but by the love for ingenuity and creativity. 
Each member learns new skills that are not learned in an every-day classroom, but can also be used outside the Robotics team setting. 
We embody the ideals of FIRST in so many ways. 
When one becomes part of our team you become part of something bigger than yourself, you get a group of friends, you get a family, and you get each other.
