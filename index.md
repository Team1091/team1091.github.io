FRC Team 1091 Oriole Assault is composed of high school students with a goal of creating a robot in 6 weeks.  During
those weeks the students have an opportunity to learn and hone skills including CAD, machining, programming, electronics,
and teamwork.

## New Student Meeting - Welcome to Robotics!
New member meeting at 5:00-6:00pm September 16th in the Drama/Lecture room.

Robotics has so much to offer! Obviously electronics and programming and machining and design and welding. 
Plus business and finance, marketing and social media management, graphic design and public speaking. 
All tied together with youth leadership and teamwork. We hope you can come join us!

The team has pre-season meetings every Thursday from 5:30-7:00pm.
During the season meetings are 5:30-8:00pm Monday to Thursday, and Saturdays from 8:00am-2:00pm.
Parents are always welcome at Robotics and there's lots of ways to help!
