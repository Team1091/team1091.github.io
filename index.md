FRC Team 1091 Oriole Assault is composed of high school students with a goal of creating a robot in 6 weeks.  During
those weeks the students have an opportunity to learn and hone skills including CAD, machining, programming, electronics,
and teamwork.

We are a family first and foremost, not related by blood, but by the love for ingenuity and creativity. 
Each member learns new skills that are not learned in an every-day classroom, but can also be used outside the Robotics team setting. 
We embody the ideals of FIRST in so many ways. 
When one becomes part of our team you become part of something bigger than yourself, you get a group of friends, you get a family, and you get each other.


## New Student Meeting - Welcome to Robotics!
New member meeting at 5:00-6:00pm September 16th in the Drama/Lecture room.

Robotics has so much to offer! Obviously electronics and programming and machining and design and welding. 
Plus business and finance, marketing and social media management, graphic design and public speaking. 
All tied together with youth leadership and teamwork. We hope you can come join us!

The team has Development meetings every Thursday from 5:30-7:00pm.
Build season meetings are 5:30-8:00pm Monday to Thursday, and Saturdays from 8:00am-2:00pm.
After Build season we have our competitions.
Parents are always welcome at Robotics and there's lots of ways to help!
