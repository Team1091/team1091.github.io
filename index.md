FRC Team 1091 Oriole Assault is composed of high school students with a goal of creating a robot in 6 weeks.  During
those weeks the students have an opportunity to learn and hone skills including CAD, machining, programming, electronics,
and teamwork.

We are a family first and foremost, not related by blood, but by the love for ingenuity and creativity. 
Each member learns new skills that are not learned in an every-day classroom, but can also be used outside the Robotics team setting. 
We embody the ideals of FIRST® in so many ways. 
When one becomes part of our team you become part of something bigger than yourself, you get a group of friends, you get a family, and you get each other.
