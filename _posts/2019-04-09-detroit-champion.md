# Road to Detroit World Championship

The Seven Rivers Regional ended on April 6th, with our team being picked by the 4th seed alliance. Our alliance members, [5442 Mechanical Monarchy](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/5442/2019), [967 Iron Lions](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/967/2019), and our team made it to quarter-finals.

Immediately after the conclusion of La Crosse our team met and began working on the logistics and acquirement of funds to go to Detroit Championship. As of the date of this post (2019-04-09), with the help of the community and our generous sponsors we have raised almost a quarter of our goal to get to Worlds. To those in the community, family, friends, and those who have stumbled across our [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/send-frc-team-1091-to-championships) for helping our progress to our first World Championship since the conception of the team!
