# Seven Rivers Regional
Starting on the 4th, our team competed at our second regional of the year.
By winning the Wisconsin Regional in Milwaukee we were able to focus in our skillset we 
need to prep for the World's Championship Competition. The team started strong by winning all of 
their practice rounds and setting the early high score of 95 points.
