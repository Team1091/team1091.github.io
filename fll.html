<h2>What is FIRST® LEGO® League?</h2>
FIRST® LEGO® League (FLL) introduces science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to children ages 4-16 through
fun, exciting hands-on learning. Participants gain real-world problem-solving experience through a
guided, global robotics program, helping today's students and teachers build a better future together.
FLL's three divisions inspire youth to experiment and grow their critical thinking, coding, and design skills
through hands-on STEM learning and robotics.
<h2> Our Core Values</h2>
<p>The FIRST Core Values are the cornerstones of the program. They are among the fundamental elements that
    distinguish FIRST LEGO League from other programs of its kind. By embracing the Core Values, participants
    learn that friendly competition and mutual gain are not separate goals, and that helping one another is the
    foundation of teamwork. We express the FIRST philosophies of Gracious Professionalism® and Coopertition®
    through our Core Values.</p>
