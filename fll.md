## What is FIRST® LEGO® League?
FIRST® LEGO® League introduces science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to children ages 4-16* 
through fun, exciting hands-on learning. Participants gain real-world problem-solving experience through a 
guided, global robotics program, helping today's students and teachers build a better future together. 
Our three divisions inspire youth to experiment and grow their critical thinking, coding, and design skills 
through hands-on STEM learning and robotics.

## Our Core Values
The FIRST Core Values are the cornerstones of the program. They are among the fundamental elements that 
distinguish FIRST LEGO League from other programs of its kind. By embracing the Core Values, participants 
learn that friendly competition and mutual gain are not separate goals, and that helping one another is the 
foundation of teamwork. We express the FIRST philosophies of Gracious Professionalism® and Coopertition® 
through our Core Values.
