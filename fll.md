## First Lego League in Hartford
FRC Team 1091 members along with community volunteers are developing a FLL program comprised of kids
in 5th-8th grade from the HUHS feeder schools.; which includes Erin, Hartford, HONOR, Holy Hill, 
Richfield, Immanuel, Peace Lutheran, St. Bonniface, St. Gabriel's, St. Killians, and St. Matthew's 

####  **At this time, we are not having families register their children yet**. 
The reason for this is that each team can only have a max of 10 participants and we are anticipating the need to create multiple teams.
With this in mind, we wanted to get a better idea of the number of participants before registering the
teams and opening individual registration. If after reviewing the information you would like your child
to be a part of the HUHS FLL teams, please just let us know and we will alert you with more information
as soon as we open up individual registration.

Contact [FLL1091Robotics@gmail.com](mailto:FLL1091Robotics@gmail.com) for more information.

## What is FIRST® LEGO® League?
FIRST® LEGO® League introduces science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) to children ages 4-16* 
through fun, exciting hands-on learning. Participants gain real-world problem solving experience through a 
guided, global robotics program, helping today's students and teachers build a better future together. 
Our three divisions inspire youth to experiment and grow their critical thinking, coding, and design skills 
through hands-on STEM learning and robotics.

## Our Core Values
The FIRST Core Values are the cornerstones of the program. They are among the fundamental elements that 
distinguish FIRST LEGO League from other programs of its kind. By embracing the Core Values, participants 
learn that friendly competition and mutual gain are not separate goals, and that helping one another is the 
foundation of teamwork. We express the FIRST philosophies of Gracious Professionalism® and Coopertition® 
through our Core Values.
