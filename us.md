# Who is Team 1091?
 We are a family first and foremost, not related by blood, but by the love for ingenuity and creativity. We are a team that builds a robot, but we are more than just that. We support and challenge each other to achieve the most we can. Each member learns new skills that are not learned in an every-day classroom, but can also be used outside the Robotics team setting. We embody the ideals of FIRST in so many ways. When one becomes part of our team you become part of something bigger than yourself, you get a group of friends, you get a family, and you get each other. This new bonded family is entirely unique, and you never lose them, they carry you through thick and thin.  Some of us pop up like a deer in the headlights, but when they leave, they will be educated, inspired, and ready to lead.
