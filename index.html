<p>Oriole Assault (Team 1091) is a high school robotics team working to build a competition-ready robot in 6 weeks. Each team member brings a 
variety of skills to the table, including programming, machining, digital design, and most of all, leadership and teamwork.

At our core, we are a family: not by blood, but by our shared love for learning and creation.

At our team meetings, we are split into 4 subteams: Build, Electrical, Programming, and Business. Our build team focuses on putting together the robot. Electrical works
	alongside build putting together the controls for the robot. Programming works on the code for the robot. Finally, business works on finding sponsers, setting up
	fundraisers, etc. Without even one of the subteams, there would be no functioning robot.
