<p>Oriole Assault (Team 1091) is a high school robotics team working to build a competition-ready robot in 6 weeks. Each team member brings a 
variety of skills to the table, including programming, machining, digital design, and most of all, leadership and teamwork.

At our core, we are a family: not by blood, but by our shared love for learning and creation.
